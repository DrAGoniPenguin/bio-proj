    <h1> Lafora Disease </h1>
  </center>
</p>

  <br>
  
  <p>
    Lafora Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy disease or Lafora Disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder where symptoms appear in late childhood and early teens.
  </p>

  <h3 id="history">History</h3>

    <p>
      Spanish neuropathologist Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora (1886-1971) first described Lafora Disease in 1911. Not much information is known about Lafora Disease due to the rarity and continuing research ongoing.

<h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>

    <p>Symptoms of Lafora Disease include, but are not limited to</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots1">
      <li>Recurrent, Increasingly Intractable Seizures (epilepsy)</li>
      <li>Ataxia (difficulty controlling muscles)</li>
      <li>Myoclonus</li>
      <li>Dementia</li>
      <li>Cognitive difficulties
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;" class = "dots2">

          <li>- Difficulty Walking</li>
          <li>- Difficulty Eating</li>
          <li>- Difficulty Speaking</li>
          <li>- Cognitive Decline</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Affected people tend to start having symptoms as an adolescent (12-17) and typically die about a decade after expressing symptoms. Epileptic seizures occur along with other neurological conditions, having a similar effect consistent to Parkinson’s Disease.</p>

<h3 id="genetics">Genetics</h3>

    <p>Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder where symptoms appear in late childhood and teens around the ages 12-18.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lafora disease causes death from neurodegeneration over time due to the buildup of intracellular cytoplasmic inclusions (Lafora bodies) in the central nervous system (brain/spinal cord), heart, muscle, and liver. The Lafora bodies test positive for pathognomonic periodic acid (Schiff positive or PAS+).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Lafora bodies/inclusions are insoluble polyglucosan buildups of long glycogen chains. The insolubility of these chains leads to </p>
    <br>
    <p>Lafora disease affects the EPM2A/B and NHLRC1 genes as discovered in the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>EPM2A codes for the laforin glucan phosphatase enzyme, which is believed to dephosphorylate glycogen to remove buildup in unsupported tissues such as the nervous system.</p>

      Lafora disease affects the EPM2A/B and NHLRC1 genes as discovered in the early 2000s.
      EPM2A codes for the laforin glucan phosphatase enzyme, which is believed to dephosphorylate glycogen to remove buildup in unsupported tissues such as the nervous system.
      <br>
      <p class="left">
        EPM2A has several other functions:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots3">
        <li>Interact with other proteins (malin from the NHLRC1 gene) that enforce autophagy</li>
        <li>Help as a tumor inhibitor protein which prevents uncontrolled cell division.</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      NHLRC1 codes for the production of a protein called malin, which helps regulate autophagy of unneeded proteins. Malin marks the unnecessary proteins with the ubiquitin molecule, which is a signal to enforce autophagy in a process called the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
      This targets proteins including Laforin from the EPM2A gene similar to a quality control 

      <br>
      <br>
      EPM2A and NHLRC1 produce the laforin and malin proteins which are believed to break down the glycogen sugar buildups together.
      Lafora Disease occurs when gene mutations occur in the NHLRC1 and EPM2A which are believed to be important for breaking down excess glycogen chains and vestigial proteins.

<h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>

    <p>
      There is no known cure as of now, and Lafora Disease is fatal in all cases documented. On average, affected victims die about 10 years after initial symptoms of epilepsy, with very few documented to survive past 40.
    </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>

    <p>
      As there is no known cure, the only possible treatments include anti-epileptic drugs to simply attempt to suppress symptoms. Some drugs include 
      Neurodegeneration over time results in the increasing care by others for an affected person’s entire life.
