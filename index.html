  <br>
  
  <p>
    Lafora Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy disease or Lafora Disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder which is most commonly present in humans and dogs.
    Lafora Disease is extremely rare with roughly 4 cases per million people, making it difficult to gather mass data, forcing researchers to use mice to simulate the disease.
    <br>
    Initial diagnosis may be confused for a more common Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) which slows down the process to identify and inhibit Lafora Disease early.

  <h3 id="history">History</h3>

    <p>
        Spanish neuropathologist Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora (1886-1971) first described Lafora Disease in 1911. Lafora first documented inclusion bodies or small protein build-ups in affected patients' skin cells, which were named "Lafora bodies."
      Previously, no information seems to have been gathered as no observable differences with other epilepsy variants had been documented.

    <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots1">
      <li>Recurrent, Increasingly Intractable Seizures (Epilepsy)</li>
      <li>Ataxia (difficulty controlling muscles)</li>
      <li>Myoclonus</li>

    <p>
      Affected people tend to start having symptoms as an adolescent (12-18) and typically die about a decade after expressing symptoms. Epileptic seizures occur along with other neurological conditions, having a similar effect consistent to Parkinson’s Disease.

<h3 id="genetics">Genetics</h3>

    <p>
      Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder where symptoms appear in late childhood and teens around the ages 12-18.
      <br>
      As a non-sex related recessive disease, males and females are equally likely to contract Lafora Disease where both parents must be carriers or where one parent must be affected.
      <br>
    </p>

    <p> A simplified genetic pedigree is shown below.</p>

    <br>
    <p>
      Lafora disease causes death from neurodegeneration over time due to the build-up of intracellular cytoplasmic inclusions (Lafora bodies) in the central nervous system (brain/spinal cord), heart, muscle, and liver.
      The Lafora bodies test positive in pathognomonic periodic acid (Schiff positive or PAS+) indicating excess glucose build-ups.
    </p>
  <br>
    <p>
      The Lafora bodies are polyglucosan build-ups of long glycogen chains similar to Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) where the chains become insoluble and unusable by the body, which also damages neuron cells.
    </p>
  <br>
    <p>
      Two genes are relevant in LD, the laforin glycogen phosphatase EPM2A/B and malin E3 ubiquitin ligase NHLRC1 genes, as discovered in the early 2000s.
      Both genes are located on Chromosome 6 of a human where 
      EPM2A codes for the laforin glucan phosphatase enzyme, believed to dephosphorylate glycogen to remove build-up in unsupported tissues such as the nervous system.
      <br>
      <p class="left">
        EPM2A has several other functions:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots3">
        <li>Interact with other proteins (malin from the NHLRC1 gene) that enforce autophagy</li>
        <li>Help as a tumor inhibitor protein which prevents uncontrolled cell division.</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      NHLRC1 codes for the production of a protein called malin, which helps regulate autophagy of unneeded proteins. Malin marks the unnecessary proteins with the ubiquitin molecule, which is a signal to enforce autophagy in a process called the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
      This targets proteins including Laforin from the EPM2A gene, where malin regulates the amount of laforin proteins in the body similar to a quality control system.

      <br>
      <br>
      EPM2A and NHLRC1 produce the laforin and malin proteins which are believed to break down the glycogen sugar build-ups together.
      <br>
      Lafora Disease occurs when gene mutations occur in the NHLRC1 and EPM2A creating serious issues:
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots3">
        <li>Laforin proteins decrease or are not produced at all:</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:none;" class = "dots2">
            <li>Regulation of glycogen size is stopped (now called Lafora bodies)</li>
            <li>Glycogen is hyperphosphorylated</li>
            <li>Glycogen chains increase in size rendering them insoluble</li> 
          </ul>

        <li>Neurotoxic poisoning </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h3>

    <p>
      There is no known cure as of now, and Lafora Disease is terminal in all cases documented. On average, affected victims die about 10 years after initial symptoms of epilepsy, with very few documented to survive past 40.
      The average/expected lifespan is about at age 26-36, with several outliers surviving in intensive care to past 50.
    </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>

    <p>
      As there is no known cure, the only possible treatments include anti-epileptic drugs to simply attempt to suppress symptoms.
      <br>
      <br>
      The most common anti-epileptic drug prescribed is valproic acid, with several alternatives if unavailable or feasible, including topiramate, etho- suximide, phenobarbital, zonisamide, felbamate, and benzodiazepines.
    
      In 2018, perampanel was shown to be effective at suppressing symptoms as an 
      α-amino- 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist anti-epileptic drug (AED).
      <br>
      Dosage amounts will vary based on how severe symptoms are, with an epileptologist or neurologist for consult and advice.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="left">

      Anti Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) can have serious side effects including:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots3">
        <li>Reliance throughout life</li>
        <li>birth defects - pregnant females should consult a doctor on effects</li>
        <li>bone structure/health may deteriate</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      Surgery may be recommended for other kinds of epilepsy if several drugs are attempted but not allievated (known as "medically refractory epilepsy").
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      Other treatment options include vagal nerve stimulation in the neck for temporary allievation from status epilepticus, which is when a patient has chronic epileptic seizures.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The National Library of Medicine held experiments on the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00007124">effectiveness of the ketogenic diet</a> in the year 2000.
      According to the National Library's experiments, the diet was ineffective, which theoretically should have worked, as the ketogenic diet forces the body to consume lipids instead of carbohydrates.
      - This switch from carbohydrates to lipids for energy reduces the amount of glucose, reducing the amount of glycogen, which in turn, removes a fuel source for making Lafora bodies. -
        
      *However, relief in induced mice leads to the belief the patients were in an advanced stage instead, making this a potential option with further research.*
      <br>
      This process of removing fuel sources is not unlike cancer treatments by reducing glucose intake to slow tumor development.
      
      <br>
      <br>

      Neurodegeneration over time results in the increasingly intensive care by others for an affected person’s life.
