          Lafora Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy disease or Lafora Disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder which is most commonly present in humans and dogs.
          Lafora Disease is extremely rare with roughly 4 cases per million people, making it difficult to gather mass data, forcing researchers to use mice to simulate the disease.
          <br>
          Initial diagnosis may be confused for a more common Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) which slows down the process to identify and inhibit Lafora Disease early.

          <p>
              Spanish neuropathologist Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora (1886-1971) first described Lafora Disease in 1911. Lafora first documented inclusion bodies or small protein build-ups in affected patients' skin cells, which were named "Lafora bodies."
            Previously, no information seems to have been gathered as no observable differences with other epilepsy variants had been documented.

          Diagnosis of Lafora Disease typically occurs through one of two methods: 
          <br>
          
          Serial single gene testing  or a multigene panel may be used to find any abnormalities in genes if phenotypes imply the possible presence of Lafora Disease.
          If the phenotypes make it 
          
          
          Exome sequences or Genome sequences.
          
          
          Exome sequencing consists of documenting only the protein producing gene region of DNA -called an exon- in a genome -called the exome.-
          The DNA is then sequenced and analyzed by available technology.
          <br>
          <br>
          Genome sequencing consists of molecularly shearing small portions of DNA and feeding the information to a machine to analyze and compare to a "normal" genotype.

            <p>
              Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder where symptoms appear in late childhood and teens.
                A sample of 298 confirmed cases of Lafora Disease showed a mean age of 13.4 years when diagnosed, and about 9.1% of the population were adults.
                More than half of patients diagnosed survived at least 11 years.
                <br>
                <br>
            <h6>Percentages of Effects</h6>
            <br>
                The chances of losing autonomy in 110 cases of affected individuals was 45% at 5 years, 75% at 10 years, and 83% at 15 years, with full loss occurring on an average of 6 years.
                The average death rate was approximately 7% at 5 years, 25% at 10 years, and 17% at 15 years old.
              <br>
              As a non-sex related recessive disease, males and females are equally likely to contract Lafora Disease where both parents must be carriers or where one parent must be affected.

            <p>
              Lafora disease causes death from neurodegeneration over time due to the build-up of intracellular cytoplasmic inclusions (Lafora bodies) in the central nervous system (brain/spinal cord), heart, muscle, and liver.
            </p>
          <br>
            <p>
              The Lafora bodies are polyglucosan build-ups of excessively long glycogen chains similar to Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) where the chains become insoluble and unusable by the body, which also damages neuron cells.
              Typically, 
            </p>
          <br>
            <p>
              Two genes are relevant in LD, the laforin glycogen phosphatase EPM2A/B and malin E3 ubiquitin ligase NHLRC1 genes, as discovered in the early 2000s.
              Both genes are located on Chromosome 6 of a human where EPM2A on chromosome 6p24 and NHLRC1 on chromosome 6p22.
              EPM2A codes for the laforin glucan phosphatase enzyme, believed to dephosphorylate glycogen to remove build-up in unsupported tissues such as the nervous system.
              <br>
              <p class="left">
                EPM2A has several other functions:
              </p>
          
              <ul style="list-style-type:square;" class = "dots3">
                <li>Interact with other proteins (malin from the NHLRC1 gene) that enforce autophagy</li>
                <li>Help as a tumor inhibitor protein which prevents uncontrolled cell division.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <br>
              NHLRC1 codes for the production of a protein called malin, which helps regulate autophagy of unneeded proteins. Malin marks the unnecessary proteins with the ubiquitin molecule, which is a signal to enforce autophagy in a process called the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
              This targets proteins including Laforin from the EPM2A gene, where malin regulates the amount of laforin proteins in the body similar to a quality control system.

              <br>
              <br>
          
              EPM2A and NHLRC1 produce the laforin and malin proteins which are believed to break down the glycogen sugar build-ups together.
              <br>
              The Lafora bodies test positive in pathognomonic periodic acid (Schiff positive or PAS+), indicating excess glucose build-ups.

              <br>
              Lafora Disease occurs when gene mutations occur in the NHLRC1 and EPM2A creating serious issues:

            <p>
              There is no known cure as of now, and Lafora Disease is terminal in all cases documented. On average, affected victims die about 10 years after initial symptoms of epilepsy, with very few documented to survive past 40.
              The average/expected lifespan is about to age 26-36, with several outliers surviving in intensive care to past 50.

        <h3 id="treatment">Treatments</h3>

            <p>
              As there is no known cure, the only possible treatments include anti-epileptic drugs to simply attempt to suppress symptoms.
              <br>
              <br>
              The most common anti-epileptic drug prescribed is valproic acid, with several alternatives if unavailable or feasible, including topiramate, etho- suximide, phenobarbital, zonisamide, felbamate, and benzodiazepines.
            
              In 2018, perampanel was shown to be effective at suppressing symptoms as an 
              α-amino- 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist anti-epileptic drug (AED).
              <br>
              Dosage amounts will vary based on how severe symptoms are, with an epileptologist or neurologist for consult and advice.
              <br>

              Other treatment options include vagal nerve stimulation in the neck for temporary allievation from status epilepticus, which is when a patient has chronic epileptic seizures.

              The National Library of Medicine held experiments on the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00007124">effectiveness of the ketogenic diet</a> in the year 2000.
              According to the National Library's experiments, the diet was ineffective, which theoretically should have worked, as the ketogenic diet forces the body to consume lipids instead of carbohydrates.
              - This switch from carbohydrates to lipids for energy reduces the amount of glucose, reducing the amount of glycogen, which in turn, removes a fuel source for making Lafora bodies. -
                
              *However, relief in induced mice leads to the belief the patients were in an advanced stage instead, making this a potential option with further research.*
              <br>
              This process of removing fuel sources is not unlike cancer treatments by reducing glucose intake to slow tumor development.

              Neurodegeneration over time results in the increasingly intensive care by others for an affected person’s life.

            People can help by donating to prominent rare disease or epilepsy foundations to help fund research into diseases and treatments.
            Raising awareness for rare diseases and encouraging people to be aware of their genotypes can help reduce the occurrences of these diseases.
